            &nbsp;&nbsp;From a young age, Kendra displayed a remarkable affinity
            for art, embarking on her creative journey at ages 8 to 14. During
            this formative period, she explored an array of artistic mediums,
            including graphite, ink, pastel, acrylic, watercolor, and oil
            painting, setting the stage for her lifelong passion.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;Graduating high school with the prestigious "District
            Dogwood Scholarship in Fine Arts," Kendra's dedication to her craft
            led her to pursue a deeper understanding of art and its integration
            with the built environment. She continued her studies at the
            University of British Columbia, studying architecture and further
            refining her artistic expression.

            sculptural art using clay, wood, and metal, showcasing her
            versatility and ability to breathe life into three-dimensional
            forms. She also embraced digital tools, skillfully employing them to
            create intricate graphics, 3D models, drafting, and rendering.

            innovation, Kendra pursued studies in software engineering,
            enhancing her proficiency in merging creativity with cutting-edge
            technology. This multidimensional approach to art underscores her
            adaptability and forward-thinking mindset.

            cultural heritage and her deep appreciation for the beauty inherent
            in the world around us. Her "vaguely impressionist" style invites
